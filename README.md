# Hacker News

A front-end code test for consuming Hacker News API.

The project was bootstrapped using Create React App in TypeScript, with Bulma as UI library.

## How to Start

Install packages:

### `npm i`

Then start normally:

### `npm start`

I was given less than a weekend to do it, didn't have time to mock API calls for components. Only managed to implement tests for utility functions, API functions and basic UI. Sorry about that.
